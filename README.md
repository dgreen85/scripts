# Random Scripts
## These are scripts I use occasionally for random things.

**web-search.py** - Takes a csv with a list of urls, searches specific containers within the HTML of those URLs for a specific phrase and outputs any serach results into a csv file with html line positions and surrounding text.


**ga4_combine.py** -  This script was writen to combine URLs from a GA4 landing page + query string report export. May need adjustments depending on columns exported.
